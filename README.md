# PROJECT TITLE: using the support vector mechanism algorithm of supervise meachine learning ,predict iris.csv dataset to find out spices will be same or not.
# ROBLEM STATEMENT:A American based botinical garden a grow ice flower in their labsbut using bio technology in a single treedifferent type of verity flower is grow.as a datascience engineer find out how much accuracy is thereall categories contains same species
# ASK1:preprocess the data in skit learn.library
# TASK2:load the data using sklearn model selection default argument.
# TASK3:On the basis of dataset train,test and split of svm model.
# TASK5:Train the classifier on the traning data.
# TASK6:Find out the predection value on the test data.
# ASK7:Test the model with the help of accuracy ,accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1
# import libraries
# Load the Iris dataset
# Consider only two classes for simplicity
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
# Create an SVM classifier
# Train the classifier on the training data
# Make predictions on the test data

# Make predictions on the test data
# Calculate accuracy

# CONCLUSION: According to my support vector mechanisam model the species are linear.with the accuray of 1.00
hence proved model was succesfully implement
